<h1>Optimus Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Optimus ("Optimus") is committed to protecting the privacy of its users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy has been created to inform you about how Optimus Cleaner manages, collects, stores and uses the information you provide in connection with any Optimus Cleaner game or application ("Application"). Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is only to information collected by Optimus Cleaner through your use of the application.</p>

<p>By using the Application, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Optimus may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and Optimus Cleaner encourages you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</p>

<h2>Information Collected</h2>

<p>Optimus Cleaner's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Application and to enable users to enjoy the Application.</p>

<p>When you install and use the Application, Optimus cleaner may collect and record the information you provide to Optimus Cleaner, whether through the Application, through your usage of the Application or through social network or other third party Applications ("<strong>User Information</strong>").</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>"Personal information" means information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. The personal information types collected in accordance with the Application may vary depending on the activity and may include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your name;</li>
<li>Your social network or third party Application user identification number;</li>
<li>Your email address;</li>
<li>Your profile picture; or</li>
<li>Any other relevant information included in your application, social network or other online profile.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, Optimus Cleaner may acquire information from you through:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your access and participation in message boards on an Application;</li>
<li>The contents of your Customer Support requests; or</li>
<li>Your purchase of a virtual product of any type.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Non-Personal Information</h2>

<p>"Non-personal information" is information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. Optimus Cleaner may collect non-personal information about your use of its Application both in the course of game play and software usage. Optimus Cleaner may also invite you to share non-personal information about yourself which may include but is not limited to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your age or date of birth;</li>
<li>Your gender;</li>
<li>Information about the hardware you may own;</li>
<li>Your favorite websites, friend information and fan pages; or</li>
<li>Any other information included in your application, social network or other online profile.</li>
</ol>

<p>If non-Personal Information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, Optimus Cleaner may combine your non-personal information with your personal information in an attempt to provide you with a better user experience, to improve the value and quality of the Application and to analyze how Applications are used. The Application may also record game play information such as your game session duration or your high scores.</p>

<p>In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose to share additional information about yourself throughout the Application, such as on message boards and in games. Any actions you perform with other players are considered public, and are in your sole discretion.</p>

<p>Other information Optimus Cleaner may collect includes your occupation, language, zip code, area code, location, and the time zone where an Application is used, as well as information about your computer, mobile device, software, platform, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC) address and connection, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity, so that Optimus Cleaner can better understand customer behavior and improve its products, Applications, and advertising. Optimus Cleaner may also receive either non-personal or public information from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies and/or data that Optimus Cleaner may use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.</p>

<h2>Use of Your Information</h2>

<h4>How Optimus Cleaner Uses Your Information</h4>

<p>Optimus Cleaner uses your information to fulfill your specific requests, purchase orders and to send you purchase confirmation and other related information. In addition, the personal information you provide will allow Optimus Cleaner to send you messages regarding, among other things, new products, features, enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of interest. You may also later opt out of certain of these communications.</p>

<p>Optimus Cleaner may also use personal and non-personal information, both individually and combined together, to better understand the behavior and preferences of its customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve static and dynamic advertising, to enforce its Terms of Application, to ensure proper functioning of its products and Applications as well as to help improve Applications and their content. In addition, Optimus Cleaner may combine non-personal information with personal information, such as an email address, to administer loyalty programs, tailor its offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.</p>

<p>By use of friend finder tools whether directly through the Application or through a social network or gaming Application, you acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help you find your contacts and will also allow your contacts to associate your Application (and related gaming entitlements, including games played, spins and coins) with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends' list will be subject to this privacy policy.</p>

<p>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion, Optimus Cleaner may use the information you provide to administer those programs. Your participation in tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon you granting Optimus Cleaner permission to collect, use, store, transmit and display publicly statistical data, such as your scores, rankings and achievements, generated through your participation.</p>

<p>In all cases of data access and collection, the information you provide may be disclosed, rented, loaned, leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties.  Generally, data will be used for the purpose of providing you with and improving the Application and for any other purpose stated herein. Optimus Cleaner will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you Applications. Note that there may be instances where Optimus Cleaner is legally required to retain your information.</p>

<h2>Access through Social Network Applications or Mobile Devices</h2>

<p>By accessing the Application through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or Application or by connecting to such a third party network, platform or Application via an Application, you are authorizing Optimus Cleaner to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the social network, mobile device or other third party platform could provide to Optimus Cleaner through the social network/mobile device/third party platform Application Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the third party social network, mobile device or platform. Your agreement takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform or Application via the Application, and/or when you connect with an Application, or "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) an Application to access your information through a social network, mobile device or other third party platform or Application.</p>

<p>Optimus Cleaner may also collect or receive information about you from other Application users who choose to upload their email contacts. This information will be stored by Optimus Cleaner and used primarily to help you and your friends connect.</p>

<h2>Third Party Application Providers</h2>

<p>Optimus Cleaner may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate its Applications, to provide the Applications on its behalf, to perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance Applications, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Applications) or to assist Optimus Cleaner in analyzing how its Applications are used.</p>

<p>From time to time, Optimus Cleaner employs third party contractors to collect personal information on its behalf to provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing or other Applications through the Application. When requesting these Applications, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address to its contractors. Optimus Cleaner may ask some third party contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or market research firms, to supplement personal information that you provide to Optimus Cleaner for its own marketing and demographic studies, so that Optimus Cleaner can consistently improve its sites and related advertising to better meet its visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich its understanding of individual customers, Optimus Cleaner may tie this information to the information you provide to it.</p>

<h2>Message Boards and Chat Rooms</h2>

<p>Note that certain information you post and communicate through an Application or a third party site or Application is public information for which you have no expectation of privacy.</p>

<p>You may choose to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to Optimus Cleaner sites or Applications or in its chat rooms, blogs, message boards, user "profiles" for public view or in similar forums on its sites through mobile Applications and/or through third party sites or Applications. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is public information, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.</p>

<p>You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the course of these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Optimus Cleaner is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to make public in any of these forums.</p>

<p>If you post a video, image or photo through an Application for public view, you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent. Optimus Cleaner is not responsible for the videos, images or photos that you choose to post through a Application.</p>

<h2>Browser Use</h2>

<p>Note that in the ordinary course of Internet activity, certain information may be sent from your browser to third parties such as advertising networks and analytics companies. Optimus Cleaner has no control over the information sent from your browser to those networks or other third parties and recommends that you ensure that your browser settings prevent the disclosure of information you would not like to share.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>You understand and agree that Optimus Cleaner may be required to disclose any personal information if required to do so by law or in the belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, including, but not to a subpoena, statute, search warrant, or court order, or to protect the property and rights of Optimus Cleaner or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity Optimus Cleaner may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. Note that Optimus Cleaner is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that it may receive.</p>

<p>Optimus Cleaner may also disclose information about you if it determines that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of the Application or to protect its operations or users. Additionally, Optimus Cleaner may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>Like many websites, Optimus Cleaner may use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk or your mobile device for record-keeping purposes. The Application may send cookies to a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views an Application. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for purposes such as improving the quality of Optimus Cleaner's Application, tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Application easier to use. Third party advertisers on the Applications may also place or read cookies on your browser. Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web browser's options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of an Application.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>The Application may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Application links to a website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that Optimus Cleaner endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave the Optimus Cleaner site you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Because Optimus Cleaner cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Optimus Cleaner. You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit before providing any personal information.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Optimus Cleaner has made reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, Optimus Cleaner cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so Optimus Cleaner discourages you from sending Optimus Cleaner personal information through these media.</p>

<h2>Policy Regarding Persons Under 21</h2>

<p>This product is intended for use by those 21 or older for amusement purposes only. Without derogating from the foregoing, Optimus Cleaner does not knowingly collect personal information from people under the age of 13. If Optimus Cleaner learns that a person under the age of 13 has provided it with personal information, Optimus Cleaner will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.</p>
