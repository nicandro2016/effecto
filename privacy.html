      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: June 2, 2016</p>
      <p>Welcome to Prisma (“Prisma,” “we,” “us” or “our”). Prisma provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to stylize your photo. Just snap a photo, choose a style to transform the look and feel, and share!</p>
      <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Prisma services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>
      <p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to stylize content.</p>
      <p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>
      <h3>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
      <p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
      <p>Information you provide us directly:</p>
      <p>User Content (e.g., photos and other materials) that you post through the Service. Communications between you and Prisma. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
      <p>Analytics information:</p>
      <p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
      <p>Cookies and similar technologies:</p>
      <p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Prisma and provide features to you.</p>
      <p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
      <p>Log file information:</p>
      <p>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
      <p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
      <p>Device identifiers:</p>
      <p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Prisma.</p>
      <p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
      <p>Metadata:</p>
      <p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</p>
      <p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you share a photo) or other data.</p>
      <h3>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing</li>
        <li>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service</li>
        <li>develop and test new products and features</li>
        <li>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns</li>
        <li>diagnose or fix technology problems</li>
        <li>automatically update the Prisma application on your device</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Prisma (or the group of companies of which Prisma is a part) without your consent, except as Parties with whom we may share your information: in this Policy.</p>
      <p>Parties with whom we may share your information:</p>
      <p>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Prisma is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos.</p>
      <p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (“Service Providers”). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p>
      <p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
      <p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.</p>
      <p>We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</p>
      <p>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</p>
      <p>Any information or content that you voluntarily stylize with the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the Prisma anonymously.</p>
      <p>What happens in the event of a change of control:</p>
      <p>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Prisma or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</p>
      <p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
